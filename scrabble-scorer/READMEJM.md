<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was the first solo project I did in Java, during my time as a trainee Software Engineer as part of Digital Futures Academy. I had previously made a Scrabble scoring program in JavaScript. Here is the same program and now it's in Java!
<br>

### Review

As preparation for this first solo Java project I enjoyed pair programming with my fellow student Haider Idris. The results of that work can be found here - https://github.com/JacDoesJS/bobs-bagels-java-jac.git
It was a good experience to work with Haider as not only had he previously learned Java but he was also able to explain things clearly in a way that was extremeley beneficial to my understanding and progress.

If I were to do this again I would seek to:-
1) find a better way to store and then loop through the hashMap I created with an array of Characters for letters of the same score.
2) complete the extended criteria

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

##### Letter Values

You'll need these:

| Letter                        | Value  |
| ----                          |  ----  |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  |     1  |
| D, G                          |     2  |
| B, C, M, P                    |     3  |
| F, H, V, W, Y                 |     4  |
| K                             |     5  |
| J, X                          |     8  |
| Q, Z                          |     10 |

Example
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

```
3 + 2x1 + 2x3 + 2 + 1
= 3 + 2 + 6 + 3
= 14
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```java

class ScrabbleRunner {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scrabble scrabble = new Scrabble("");
      scrabble.score();   // => 0

      scrabble = new Scrabble(null);
      scrabble.score();   // => 0

      scrabble = new Scrabble("a");
      scrabble.score(); // => 1

      scrabble = new Scrabble("f");
      scrabble.score(); // => 4

      scrabble = new Scrabble("street");
      scrabble.score(); // =>, 6

      scrabble = new Scrabble("quirky");
      scrabble.score(); // => 22

      scrabble = new Scrabble("OXYPHENBUTAZONE");
      scrabble.score(); // => 41
   }
}
```

## Extended Acceptance Criteria
> Each `Scrabble` method should be no more than 5 lines and contain no more than 5 operations.

> You can play a double or a triple letter.

> You can play a double or a triple word.
