<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->  

## About The Project

A banking project created using test driven development and Jasmine npm test, applying principles of OOD.
This is my first solo test-driven project using Jasmine.
This is my first example of writing loosely-coupled code following the principles of encapsulation.  


</br>

## Review
Attempting to incorporate a lot of new theory and programming knowledge was initially incredibly challenging and ultimately thoroughly satisfying. I am really keen to make another project now, following similar principles, in order to reinforce my learning. 

If I were to do this again, I would seek to:-
1. incorporate some error handling.
2. find a more elegant way to print out the statement table
3. add a conditional method to check that the amount to be paid in is greater than 1
4. add a conditional method to check that there are sufficient funds in the account to make a withdrawal  
   
I would love to attach this to a frontend user interface and think I almost know how to do it - which surely is close enough to give it a try!

## Criteria
The criteria for the project are as follows:-

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date       || credit  || debit  || balance
14/01/2012 ||         || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 ||        || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 ||        || 1000.00
```
</br>

</br>

## User Stories  
These were developed from the criteria given above...  


>As a user  
when I make a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
I want the details to be stored so they can be printed on my bank statement  

<br/>

```
| Objects | Properties    | Messages | Output           |
| ------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| account | credit amount | credit() | @number, @string |
```
1a. test that amount added  
  
1b. test that type of transaction is recorded  

1c. test that date in correct format  
 
1d. test that balance is updated  

1e. test that balance, type, and amount are stored in statementArray

when I make a withdrawal of a 500 on 14th January 2012

```

2. test that amount is correctly stored on statementArray  
  
<br/>

>As a user  
To see the running balance of my account
